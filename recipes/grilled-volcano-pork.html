    <h1>Grilled Volcano Pork</h1>

    <p>This is one of the most delicious pork dishes You'll ever eat, it's an absolute eruption of flavor!
    But that's not why it's called volcano pork. That's actually because the marinade used here is loosely
    based on one from a restaurant named after a famous Indonesian volcano. Serve this over steamed or coconut rice.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced lemongrass</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 Peppers, fresno, raw</li>
        <li>1 Pepper, serrano, raw</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 medium limes, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Slice the pork loin across into 1/2-inch thick pieces. Place into a large plastic zip-top bag.</li>
        <li>Add lemongrass, ginger, Fresno chiles, serrano chile, shallot, garlic, turmeric, pepper, cumin,
        cayenne, brown sugar, lime juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, and oil to a blender or food processor, and blend on high until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade into the bag of pork and massage thoroughly and toss until it's evenly coated. Seal the bag, squeezing out excess air as you do.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the refrigerate and marinate overnight, or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat. Remove pork from bag, wiping off most of the excess marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
